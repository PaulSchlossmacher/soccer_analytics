# Soccer Analytics

This is my contribution to a group project, where we analysed England's national team in the qualifiers to Euro 2024. The data we used for the project is provided by Wyscout and Skillcorner and it is not publicly available.

In this repository you can find code to analyse the following:

- Runs in the offensive phase
- Set-pieces
- Defensive pressing structure

Below, I give some examples of plots you can create with this repository.

## Runs

Here we found that among Harry Kane's runs, where he received a cross at the end of them, most of them were very narrowly centered around the penalty spot.

## Free-kicks

Notice the free-kick that was played short, were in the plot Bukayo Saka seems to have taken a direct free-kick from inside the penalty area :wink:

# Defensive pressing structure

We calculated the PPDA by England for each game:

And we also analysed in which areas England won the ball back most frequently:
